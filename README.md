# Mock Portfolio 

This project is a mock portfolio site . 
Within this project I will be utilising styled components, React Router Dom and React.js Functional Components as well as Hooks to ensure the code is more effecient. In addition I will ensure the webpage is able to be sized to fit desktop sized devices. 


Will be uploaded on Vercel once complete.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
